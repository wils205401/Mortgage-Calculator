# Mortgage-Calculator

The code implements a mortgage calculator that calculates and returns the payment per period (e.g. monthly payment) based on four variables: loan 
amount, loan term, annual interest rate, payment frequency. The program interacts with the user for variable input and has two main functionalities. The code can
simply return the payment amount each period, or return the whole payment schedule (from starting date to the date of final payment) showing additional information
such as the remaining balance, interest payments, and principal payments. 

### Motivation 
Unless you are part of the minority that has enough money to make a one-off payment to purchase property, you will likely need a mortgage. This tool helps you 
automate your real estate analysis, allowing you to play around with different variables to help find the mortgage loan that best suits your needs. 

## Usage
Save the code in a specified folder and run it in two ways: (1) Using a text editor, or (2) using the terminal (CMD).

If you have chosen to use the command prompt, navigate to the folder with the _mortgage.py_ file and type the following:
```
C:\relative\path\to\file> python mortgage.py
```
